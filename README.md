# anon-finance-software
Some code I wrote over two month-long internships for small financial companies, left anonymous for privacy reasons.
All code has been edited to remove any private information.

All of the code has been written solely by me and is free for reuse, but credit would be appreciated.

generate-excel: Used to generate an excel spreadsheet from scratch to contain holding data, uses some pyautogui to simulate key presses due to not having access to an available eVestment API for Python.

evest-to-perf-sheet: Takes an excel spreadsheet and does a lot of formatting using python commands. It was pretty cool to see how much manual styling you can do with just one styling library, especially in Python of all languages.
